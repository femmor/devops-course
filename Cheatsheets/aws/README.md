# AWS Lightsail - Create a Linux Instance

For most of the course using free tier AWS Lightsail is sufficient.

https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/
- Options: Linux, OS Only, Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- Go with a Free tier instance 

Note: There may be fees for storage and bandwidth. The fees should be minimal. Make sure to stop/destroy instances that you are no longer using.  In later chapters you can use Terraform to bring up and down instances as they are needed.
