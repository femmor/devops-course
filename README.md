## Course Overview

In this course you will learn the essential knowledge you should know to become a DevOps Engineer. This course is designed to be hands on and practical. There are lectures that give a high level overview of the topics, but the majority of the course is hands on labs. I have also included Cheatsheets and Study Guides to help you review the material.

## Labs Folder
The Labs folder contains a README with instructions on how to complete the Lab. You can also follow along with the video in the course. All videos will link to the lab they are associated with. Keep in mind that the folder structure/names may change as the course is updated.

## Cheatsheets Folder
We learn a lot of different technologies in this course. The Cheatsheets folder contains a cheatsheet for each technology we learn. These cheatsheets are designed to be a quick reference for you to use when working with these technologies. These are my personal cheatsheets that I use daily as a Senior DevOps Engineer.

## Study Guides Folder
Sometimes videos videos and labs are not enough to become an expert in a technology. The Study Guides folder contains a study guide for each technology we learn. These study guides are designed to help you learn the technology in more depth. They are also designed to help you prepare for the certification exams. They contain the key concepts of the technology as well as external links to help you learn more.
