# DevOps Course Repository

Hi I am Brad and welcome to the DevOps Course repository! This repository contains the materials and resources for [DevOps Engineer - Beginner to Advanced]. This course is designed to teach you the practical skills you need to become a DevOps Engineer.  You will learn how to use the most popular DevOps tools like Git, Jenkins, Terraform, Ansible, Kubernetes, Docker, and AWS. You will also learn how to use these tools together to build a CI/CD pipeline.

This repository contains Labs as well as Cheat Sheets for the tools we will be using in this course.  The Labs are designed to be completed in order.

I also have more content on YouTube that compliments this course! [DevOps Journey][youtube] ðŸš€
